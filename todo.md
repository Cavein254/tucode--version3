1. Create an organizational option where individuals can create and answer questions
   that relate to their own product or organization. It can be a sort of private community as with an admin having the ability to add members.
   Posibility of using nosql db for such?

   TABLES
   Group
   GroupID -> Generated by mongodb
   user_id -> a referential id linking back to postgres creator of the group
   users -> number of users who have access to the group

\*\* On second note it would be a replication of the postgres data.
Therefore better implementation should be considered to consider group association

2. Direct messaging. One should be able to directly message other client. It should be
   a many to many relationship one user can message multiple Users

TABLES
//Message foreign key user
MESSAGE
message_id -> autogenerated
body
timestamp
sender
receiver
